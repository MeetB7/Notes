UPPER BOUND - WORST CASE
O(n²)       ~selection, bubble sort           read as big o of n square or order of n square
O(n logn)   ~Merge Sort
O(n)        ~linear search
O(log n)    ~binary search
O(1)

LOWER BOUND - BEST CASE
Ω use alt 234 to type omega
Ω(n²)       ~slection sort
Ω(n logn)   ~Merge Sort
Ω(n)        ~bubble sort
Ω(log n)
Ω(1)        ~linear, binary
If LOWER AND UPPER BOUND ARE SAME USE Θ (alt 233)
eg. If you want to count everyone in the room, there is no better or worse case then counting 'n' numbers.
