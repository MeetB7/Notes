clang -o hello hello.c
./hello

"clang hello.c" will create a.out file by default. a.out = assembler output

 for 3rd party libraries like cs50
 clang -o hello hello.c -lcs50

These are command line arguments
"make hello" automates this process

STEPS - 

1. Preprocessing: it looks for all # files and sort of copies and pastes the code in that file so that you can use those functions
2. Compiling: it converts the code into 'assembling language' -some sort of encryption
3. Assembling: it converts the assembly code to machine code i.e. 0's and 1's
4. Linking: it links my code, code of cs50 and code of stdio and other libraries
